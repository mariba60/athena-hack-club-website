Project #1: Website

Welcome to my page dedicated to red velvet cake! Use the navbar to learn about the flavor, learn about the origins of the cake, view photos of different red velvet desserts, identify the key differences in each variation, and even find recipes for red velvet desserts!

I created this project because I enjoy baking cakes and red velvet is a very unique and interesting flavor. There are a lot of misconceptions about this well-known and loved cake flavor, and my website addresses these misconceptions. Sources for the information are linked at the bottom of the page!

I made this website using HTML and CSS. I incorporated fonts, images, hyperlinks, alternate-texts, headers, and a navbar to make my webpage aesthetically pleasing and user-friendly.

The biggest challenge I had was while making the cards. I struggled to remove the underlines from the hyperlinks, display the cards next to each other, and resize the images. I resolved the formatting issue using flexbox in my CSS. I was also able to adjust the sizing for the images after organizing the cards within containers and assigning id's/classes to the cards/elements. I learned the importance of keeping code organized, especially in hierarchical languages such as HTML and CSS. I also learned that sometimes, it's important to just be patient because the changes simply haven't been processed yet!
